Milestone 2 Reflection

	So I’m going to start this out by saying I got nowhere close to finishing this project. I’ve got some cards with sprites that
appear on the screen, and some code that would eventually let them flip from their face to their back, and vice versa, in the
right conditions, but that’s about it. And I’ve reached a point where I physically can not bring myself to work on this 
project anymore, so I’ve finally decided to call it a day and move on.
  My main problem was that I started later than I’d originally wanted to. I had a couple of other projects I was working on at 
the time, and this one got kind of pushed to the side while I invested more time in those. When I did eventually start 
working on this, I tried to use the code from the first 2D card game as a jumping off point, but my efforts didn’t pan out, 
and I ended up having to scrap that first attempt and start over from scratch. I ended up trying to follow along with a 
helpful tutorial, as suggested by a friend, and eventually just ran out of time and energy.
	I’m frustrated that I wasn’t able to get this done, or even close to done really, but lesson learned I guess. I’ll be extra 
sure to block out enough time for all my various projects next time around. As for the positives of this whole assignment, I 
was able to get a better understanding of Unity through the tutorials I watched. Also working more with sprites and lists 
was pretty cool, and I think I’ve got a better grasp on both of those now.
